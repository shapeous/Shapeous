            <h1>About Me</h1>
            
            <p>The short story is that I am a Web developer.  The longer story starts in 1997.  At the time, I was a sophomore at the City College of New York in NYC. I was pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.  That's when I discovered the Web.  I was immediately fascinated by it.  It really captivated my imagination, and I was ecstatic when I discovered I could be part of it.  Our school system was setup so that any student could have their own Web site.  I jumped to the opportunity, so with the help of some awesome guys I met there, I had my first Web site up and running within minutes of learning this.  I did not know at the time, but in years to come, I would cherish this episode in my life.</p>
            
            <p>This is where I learned the basics of most things I do today.  As I mentioned before, one of the things that made this experience great were the friends I made.  They were all lab rats and I would only see them there.  The exception was my best friend li who was also my classmate and we took many classes together.  To this day, I regret not keeping in touch with any of them.  Either way, they were all just as excited as I was about the Web.  We shared a lot, but also competed a lot.  The combination is what I think pushed us to learn more and I believe it is the essence of what made this experience so special.</p>
            
            <p>I graduated in the year 2000. Despite how awesome this experience felt, I did not get a Web development job right off college.  To be honest, I did not value enough what I learned because I learned it outside the classroom.  I also did not want to hustle as hard as I needed to pursue this career, and I got a job and when that happened, it made my decision easy.  If I only could have predicted the future, but this job although it was more traditional Computer Science, It seemed like a great opportunity.</p>
            
            <p>Due to downsizing because of the Dot-com collapse, I end-up losing that job within six months.  Only considering job security as a factor, my strategy after that was to go into hardware support.  The idea being that if they need you physically, they can't outsource you.  It worked but it kept me away from Web developing.  That said, I was not unhappy in hardware. In fact, this is where I discovered something important about myself.  As software developers, we do not always get the opportunity to interact with our clients and see how our solutions help make their lives better in whatever small way that may be.  In hardware, you always interact with people and witness first hand the positive effect of your work.  This is where I discovered, I get great satisfaction in helping people.  The only problem with this field is that it was never going to be like Web development.</p>
            
            <p>Software development is what I love to do.  In school, that's where I did the best, and it seems to come naturally to me.  Even today, say I am writing code to display "Hello, World!" on the screen using a language I am learning, I still enjoy that very much.  The more complex the problems is, and the more I have to learn to solve it, the greater the reward for me.  Nothing else seems to give me the same level of satisfaction as writing code, and so in 2006, two years after getting my Master of Science in Computer Science, I decided to transition back into software development.  Specifically, I wanted to be a Web developer.  Ever since I got my Masters, I thought about the prospect, but this time I succeeded because I was particularly motivated to leave the worst job I ever had.</p>
            
            <p>Just like getting a good traditional Computer Science job kept me away from Web development, now having a terrible hardware job brought me closer.  I started to look for technologies to revisit.  Back with my friends in my college years, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java, but also Perl for back-end development, so it was the LAMP stack what I was leaning towards revisiting.  After doing some research however, I realized there was a newer special purpose language called PHP.  I liked the fact that it was designed to be a Web development language, and since it looked like a simpler Perl, I felt right at home.  I think I bought one of the first PHP and MySQL books and I started to read it and without wasting time I also started to apply to jobs.</p>
            
            <p>My first gig was in NJ and that's where I learned ColdFusion, CFML.  By the way, as of this writing, so far, I have never used PHP professionally.  Like PHP, CFML is also a special purpose Web development language, but that's where the similarities end.  I am not going to go into how I think they are different, but by the time I got this job, I only read half way through the book, so I still relied heavily on what I learned with my friends or otherwise in College.  What I noticed is that things that were fairly complicated in Java (something I learned in college courses), like connecting and querying databases, and creating Web Services, were ridiculously simple in ColdFusion.  I, like many people, drive satisfaction from being able to do difficult things, so at first, I did not want to like this CFML magic that made everything easy.  I arrogantly felt that it was a toy language.  Nowadays of course, it is exactly this simplicity and power that I appreciate and like the most about CFML.  The less I have to bother with the language, the more time I have to focus on the solution I am trying to solve.</p>
            
            <p>This first job exposed me to different application architectures and styles.  It was the first time I came across back-end frameworks, I got my first lessons on project management and my first serious database development work.  It was also the first time I created a Web service to be consumed by a vendor so they could interact with us.</p>
            
            <p>In my second job I used my first Object Oriented MVC framework. They also married CFML with Perl using them both at their strengths. It was cool to get another chance to code in Perl, this time at a higher, more professional level.  I also got exposed to ActionScript and helped create the back-end to a FLEX application taking both my CFML and SQL skills to the next level.</p>
            
            <p>In 2009, I got my third job which relocated me to NY Capital Region. CFML-wise it was like stepping 10 years back in time.  Obviously, that sounds bad and I will for now on make sure to ask more details about the age of the technology stack in future job interviews, but this job was very good for me and I am not sure I would have done better in any other job.  The tech stack being so behind in time made someone like myself who was fairly up to date appear like a forward thinker and made my ideas seem more insightful and innovative.  Of course, back in those days things did not move quite as fast as they move today so staying up to date was considerably easier, but just as I got that job, the Web changed, and things started to accelerate and they have not stopped yet.  Either way, I had no time to worry about cutting edge stuff.  I had to learn Fusebox 3.0 (very old school), which turned out to be an awesome CFML framework based on circuitry.  The idea being of composition by features (or circuits) where you can compose complex features from simpler ones and compose your entire application by putting all those features together.  If it sounds familiar it's because modern frameworks today, in cutting-edge languages like Ruby and Node, use similar architectural designs because it's a more intuitive way to organize code as applications grow larger and larger.  Lastly, I did so well in this job that within six months of being there, I transitioned into management.  This was a very high point in my life and I felt everything I touched turned into gold.  Nevertheless, I was challenged by this promotion and humble by the lessons I learned.  I am not going to lie, I struggled at first and things got worse before they got better.  Who would have thought, leaders actually work very very hard before they can work smart.  Despite my original struggle, I cherish this experience though, I learned a ton of stuff specially SDLC, particularly QA, agile project management, leadership, and the importance of managing expectations.  Half way through, I actually got quite good at it that others who I looked up to started to complement me.</p>
            
            <p>It all was good in my world until a former coworker contacted me about an opportunity in Web development.  Given my love for programming, the thought of going back to it did cross my mind a few times of course, but having a stable job I liked made the thought quickly vanish each time.  With this perspective job being real in the sense that, I would not have to go look for it and having someone actually recommending me, made it hard to not consider it further.  However, the more I would consider it, the greater the identity crisis I would experience.  Either way, I soon realized I had to make one of the hardest decisions in my life.  My struggle was that I looked at my progression into management as a step forward in my career and I worked very hard at getting where I was, and so the idea of taking a Web development job felt like a self-demotion, a step back.  If I looked at it from that perspective alone, I would have stayed a manager, but at the end of the day, I had to ask myself what I loved more.  I love many aspects of management particularly leadership, but at that point, I still loved Web development more and so I went to the interview and the rest is history.  Of course, this does not mean I have abandoned leadership.  Actually, I do not see myself doing Web development for ever so I know I will come back one day.  In the meantime though, I think these are very exiting times to be a Web developer and I am happy to be one and I will take any opportunity for a chance to experience again what I felt with my friends in college.</p>
            
            <p>By the time, I got my fourth Web development job, I had been a Manager just as long as I had been a Web developer.  Of course, I do miss some things particularly interacting with lots of people who needed my help.  Having a hard time getting back into the flow of things made me more than once question my decision, but I now know I made the right call.  Although, we are not cutting-edge what attracted me to this job is the technology stack.  I definitely saw the potential for growth.  We recently made some decisions which will catapult us to cutting edge.  There will definitely be more about this job.  Since it is my current job the history is still in the making.</p>
